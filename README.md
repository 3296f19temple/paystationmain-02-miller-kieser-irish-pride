#Lab 4

##Requirements
We were tasked with adding a main to the existing Paystation that we had worked on in a previous lab. We also needed to use branches and pull requests to change up how we work as a team. We were also required to use certain rate strategies via one of four different methods for doing this. We used Method 3 to accomplish the task.

We used the Polymorphic model to make our new Paystation work and we chose this one because it made the most sense to us. We also wanted a bit of a challenge and the first two models seemed two easy and tedious. 

##Team work
We split up the work a bit and were able to meet once outside of the lab to accomplish our task. Liam worked on the writing the main and making sure it worked by testing on the fly using the console. Liam also created the UML and did some of the writing in this README. Curtis worked on the implementation of the Rate Strategy and did the testing for that. Curtis also contributed to the writing in this README and the UML diagram. Curtis also locked the master and created the branch we used for our work.

##Testing
Liam did some basic, on-the-fly manual testing while writing the code. Of course, there were a few bugs and they were resolved.
